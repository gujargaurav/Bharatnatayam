🚀 SQL Fundamentals – SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY

These are the basic SQL commands used to retrieve and organize data in a relational database. Let’s break them down with examples and hands-on exercises.
1️⃣ SELECT – Retrieving Data

The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from a database table.
📝 Syntax:

SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;

✅ Example:

Retrieve all customer names and their emails from the Customers table.

SELECT customer_name, email FROM Customers;

🔹 * selects all columns from the table:

SELECT * FROM Customers;

2️⃣ WHERE – Filtering Data

The WHERE clause filters records based on conditions.
📝 Syntax:

SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;

✅ Example:

Retrieve customers from India only.

SELECT customer_name, email FROM Customers WHERE country = 'India';

🔹 Use comparison operators (=, >, <, >=, <=, !=):

SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE order_amount > 500;

🔹 Use logical operators (AND, OR, NOT):

SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE country = 'India' AND city = 'Delhi';

3️⃣ GROUP BY – Aggregating Data

The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows. It is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN).
📝 Syntax:

SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2) FROM table_name 
GROUP BY column1;

✅ Example:

Find the total sales per customer from the Orders table.

SELECT customer_id, SUM(order_amount) AS total_spent
FROM Orders
GROUP BY customer_id;

🔹 Count the number of orders per country:

SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM Customers
GROUP BY country;

4️⃣ ORDER BY – Sorting Results

The ORDER BY clause sorts the results in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.
📝 Syntax:

SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name 
ORDER BY column1 ASC|DESC;

✅ Example:

Retrieve top 5 highest orders from the Orders table.

SELECT * FROM Orders 
ORDER BY order_amount DESC 
LIMIT 5;

🔹 Sort customers by name in alphabetical order:

SELECT * FROM Customers 
ORDER BY customer_name ASC;

🔥 Hands-on SQL Exercises

Try running these queries in a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server):

1️⃣ Get the names and emails of customers from "USA".
2️⃣ Find the total number of orders for each customer.
3️⃣ Get the top 3 highest order amounts.
